# Building-a-Small-Language-Model
Building a Small Language Model from Scratch in Python

Part 1: Foundations — From Text to Tokens

1. Introduction: What Is a Small Language Model (SLM)?
→ Explain architecture, tokenization, and what makes “small” models special.

2. Collecting and Cleaning Your Dataset
→ Use open text sources (TinyStories, Gutenberg, wikitext). Show cleaning & normalization in Python.

3. Building a Simple Tokenizer from Scratch
→ Implement Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or WordPiece tokenizer in Python — step by step.

4. Converting Text into Numerical Data
→ Create a vocabulary, encode text into token IDs, and build a dataloader with PyTorch.
